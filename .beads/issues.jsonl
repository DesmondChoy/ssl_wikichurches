The metrics always show values computed against the union of ALL bounding boxes for the image.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe metrics are pre-computed using `annotation.get_union_mask()` (union of all bboxes) and stored in SQLite keyed by `(image_id, model, layer, method, percentile)`. The `selectedBboxIndex` state in the frontend is never passed to the metrics API — it only affects the visual overlay rendering.\n\n### Code path:\n- `ImageDetail.tsx:39-45`: `useImageMetrics(decodedId, model, layer, percentile, method)` — no bbox index param\n- `useAttention.ts:32-33`: query key and API call omit bbox selection\n- `metrics_service.py`: queries SQLite by `(image_id, model, layer, method, percentile)` only\n- `generate_metrics_cache.py`: pre-computes with `compute_image_iou()` which calls `get_union_mask()`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a bbox is selected, the metrics card should update to show IoU/Coverage for that specific bbox vs the attention map. When no bbox is selected (or selection is cleared), show the current union-of-all-bboxes metric.\n\n## Notes\n\n- `compute_per_bbox_iou()` already exists in `iou.py:317-348` and is used during precompute for the Feature Breakdown table\n- Per-bbox metrics could be pre-computed and stored in a new SQLite table, or computed on-the-fly since single-bbox IoU is cheap\n- Coverage for a single bbox would use `compute_coverage(attention, single_bbox_mask)` instead of the union mask\n- Verified via Playwright testing: clicking different bboxes (Round Arch Window 9%x11%, Blind Arcade 19%x17%) produces zero change in displayed metrics","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T22:04:51.907943+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-06T22:51:58.86816+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T22:51:58.86816+08:00","close_reason":"Resolved: per-bbox metrics now update in the UI when a bbox is selected (commit c7aaccf)"}
